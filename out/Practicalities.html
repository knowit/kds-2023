We have created a slack-channel,<!-- --> <a class="paragraphLink" href="https://knowit.slack.com/archives/kds2021">#kds2021</a>, for everything regarding the conference, join us and get the latest news!

As the conference will be held in Stockholm, we will follow Sweden’s national guidelines in addition to Knowit’s internal COVID-19 guidelines. We will also take the situation in participants’ home countries into consideration. In the event that the vaccine rollout is delayed or if new variants of COVID-19 spread across countries, we might be forced to postpone the event.</p><p><strong>Solidarity.</strong> As in previous years, we embrace solidarity at Knowit, which means that we all pay the same amount for the conference, regardless of whether we are a speaker or not, where we live, or whether we might need a hotel room. This also applies if you are interested in just holding a presentation and not attending the rest of the conference. Our ambition is that everyone attends the entire conference to meet and learn from fellow colleagues at other Knowit companies.</p><p><strong>Great opportunity.</strong> We believe that this conference is a great opportunity to get better acquainted with others engaged in system development at Knowit. We think it’s important to participate in these kinds of events in order to create a good climate for cooperation across the company, in addition to the great program.</p><p><strong>Payment.</strong> The fee for the conference will be 3900 SEK, excluding VAT. In addition to the conference, this includes lunch and dinner on Friday, and lunch on Saturday. For those travelling to Stockholm, an overnight stay in a shared double room and breakfast at the hotel on Saturday is also included. If you prefer, you can pay 600 SEK extra to get a single room. Travel costs for those who need to travel to Stockholm are not included.</p><p><strong>Location.</strong> We have booked the<a class="paragraphLink" href="https://www.scandichotels.com/hotels/sweden/stockholm/scandic-continental"> Scandic Continental Hotel </a>for accommodation and as our conference venue. It is located in the city center and is very easy to get to either by<a class="paragraphLink" href="https://www.flygbussarna.se/en/arlanda"> bus </a>or<a class="paragraphLink" href="https://www.arlandaexpress.com/"> Arlanda Express </a>from the<a class="paragraphLink" href="https://www.swedavia.com/arlanda/"> airport</a>.
