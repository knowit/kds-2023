# Knowit Developer Summit

## Getting started

Development requirements: node.js.

### Get code and install dependencies

$ git clone git@github.com:knowit/kds.git \
$ cd kds \
$ npm install 

### Change content

edit stuff in templates \
`npm run build` builds index.htm \
`npm start` runs jade with watch \
don't forget to commit changes in index.html.

DO NOT EDIT index.html! It is auto-generated and your changes will disappear the next time someone changes something in the jade-files.
