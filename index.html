        <h3>Practical information</h3>
        <p>If you have questions during or before the conference, please feel free to contact us on Slack. We have created a slack-channel, <a href="https://knowit.slack.com/archives/kds2019">#kds2019</a>, for everything regarding the conference, join us and get the latest news! No account on slack? Then <a href="https://knowit.slack.com/signup">sign up</a> first.</p>
        <p><strong>Dinner.</strong> We will eat dinner together on Friday evening. More information later.</p>
        <p><strong>Name badges</strong> will be handed out in order to make it easier with names and companies.</p>
        <p><strong>Hotel check inn</strong>. You will be able to pick up your room key at the hotel reception sometime after 16:00 on Friday.</p>
        <p>Please stay until the end on Saturday. <strong>All speakers deserve an audience.</strong></p>
        <p>Be prepared to change room. We do not know how popular sessions will be. Perhaps we will have to switch the room just before a session starts. Please help us make it as smooth as possible.</p>
        <p>A speaker slot may become available last minute. Do you have a talk that you can present? Please prepare to quickly jump in as a speaker.</p>
        <p>The talks with this symbol ðŸŽ¥ next to them will be recorded. These will either be uploaded to the official Knowit YouTube channel or Shareit, depending on speakersâ€™ preferences. Look out for a newsletter from Creative Crew following the conference with links to the talks. NB: please be aware that there might be some last minute changes in the program. Hence, it is always better to attend the talk at the conference rather than relying on being able to watch a recording at a later time.</p>
        <p>We have, once again, made a cool <strong>KDS t-shirt</strong>. Please, just take one and note that there are different sizes for men and women.</p>
        <p><strong>Share!</strong> Use hashtag <strong>#kds2019</strong> on twitter, blog on your company blogs and make this conference visible to everyone! There is lots of great content to be shared. But, please be careful not to share something that is marked as confidential or is customer related.</p>

        <h3>The Quick Version</h3>
        <p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>
        <h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>
        <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
        <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
        <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.</p>
        <p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
        <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>
