              {`The idea of holding a conference "by developers, for developers" arose sometime 
            around 2012 within Knowit Objectnet in Norway, thanks to Fredrik Vraalsen, Alf Kristian
            St√∏yle, Tobias "tobiast" Torrissen and Jan Henrik Gundelsby). It was important that the
            conference's title make clear that the conference was for developers; thus, Knowit Developer.`}

              {`The word "Summit" was added quite undramatically; its use may have been inspired by the "Colorado
            Software Summit". The target group for the conference was the passionate system developers from
            Knowit, especially within the Java- and .NET- platforms. The goal was that as many of the participants
            as possible would also be speakers - preferably all. With this arrangement, it also became clear that
            no external speakers would be invited.`}
