      "description": "In a hospital lots of different systems are used and usually they do not work very well together. At the same time systems need to share information with each other and patients and authorities want information regardless of the system that stores the information. To solve this problem we are building a service bus for the county of Västerbotten, based on principles for domain driven architecture, SOA, REST and MicroServices, using .Net and Web API. The service bus handles routing, service discovery and has an engagement index that keeps track of patients and in which system they have data. Although every service is independent of the other a lot of functionality is the same for every service, therefore we created a framework existing of NuGet packages. As part of the project we also build a web portal on top of the service bus that makes the information about the patients accessible for the hospital's employees. In this talk I will discuss the challenges but most important the solutions we are working on to solve those integrations.",

You will get answers to the following questions: How can you code without nulls? What if you could do calculations with units of measurements such as m/s ? Using extension methods without extension methods, how? How can you get value equality for free? I have a lot of existing C# or VB code. Can I somehow benefit from F#? Finally we will explore tools that you can use to get acquainted with F# scripting and tools which you can use with your existing .NET projects and beyond.",

      "description": "During the last few years containers have become a common word in the tech vocabulary. There are many providers that offer solutions for managing containers for example Google Cloud Platform, Amazon AWS and Mesosphere. This talk will introduce Kubernetes from Google, a orchestration tool that offer automated deployment, scaling and management of your containers. You will learn the core concepts and features of Kubernetes and gain insight in how it differs from similar solutions like Amazon Container Service or Mesosphere. I will also give a live demo of these features. The demo will show how to easily load balance between multiple container instances, auto scale your application and how to do canary releases and rolling upgrades with zero down time.",

This talk will be a brief presentation on the grammars of programming languages, ASTs, compilers/interpreters, and other concepts you might know exist, but haven't really thought about how work. In the end, we’ll do a quick look at my solution and hopefully extend the language a bit. The level of the talk will be around where I was when I started the project: I knew how to use a couple of different languages, but compiler, interpreters, and that kind of stuff was magical.",

The N-body problem is a collection of problems of how objects or particles interact with each other given an initial speed, a direction and a force that acts upon all other ojects (for instance gravity). This is relevant in many aspects of our lives today, like astrophysics, medicine or the simulation of weather patterns. I plan to talk about the N-body problem, and show what a serial and parallel implementation of the problem would look like.",

Machine learning has long been a somewhat academic discipline, its practitioners highly specialized. But with the advent of a new class of commoditized machine learning platforms, MLaaS, Machine Learning as a Service, is now available to all developers. MLaaS can be treated as a black box, giving developers the opportunity to dive into machine learning head first. Supply your own data, build a model using tools supported by your chosen MLaaS platform and train it using the well tested algorithms offered. When ready to dig deeper into the world of machine learning, most MLaaS platforms enables us to develop our own algorithms even better tailored to our data and models. This talk will show you the state of the art of MLaaS, what the different vendors offers, and where you best can put it to use in your applications.",

Getting properly hacked is one of those things that is a lot more comfortable to prevent beforehand than to gather the shattered pieces afterwards. In this talk, we will take a practical approach to good personal digital security. We will start with the easy parts before drilling through the layers of security, down to the parts that are unpredictable and dangerous. Bring your laptop and a tin foil hat. Topics include: What it's like to get properly hacked. Using password managers. Operating system security. Browser security. Encryption, firewalls, factors, and other means of protection. All audiences. No code. All practical application. Perfect if you've watched the show \"\"Mr. Robot\"\" You will hopefully learn to, as they say, \"\"get your shit together\"\" when it comes to personal security.\"",

Cylon.js is a node.js based JavaScript framework for robtics and physical computing. It supports an extensive range of hardware, from remote controlled toys to IoT devices. Cylon.js is great for abstracting away the annoying aspects of hardware coding, leaving the fun part: seeing your code bridge the gap from the digital to the physical world.
