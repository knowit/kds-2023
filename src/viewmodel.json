Forcing the user is not very sucsessfull, instead of making passwords difficult for computers, policies leads to difficult passwords for users. Users struggle to remember passwords, leading them to use common phrases, shorten passwords, and reuse passwords. Making passwords even more insecure\n\nWe know people are bad at passwords, but what are they good at? \n\nIn my presentation i will discuss why user interfaces invites to bad password practises, before moving on to talk about human skills that can be used to shape users actions into more secure behaviour. Then giving exsamples of ways of making userfiendly security. \n\n\n<br />Difficulty: Beginner<br />Tags: Ux, Security, emotional design",
