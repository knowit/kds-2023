Maybe it will, maybe it won’t. I will not tell you, but I will show you.",

      "Description": "Kotlin allows for compiling to many different platforms/languages through different kotlin modules. Kotlin/JVM compiles for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Kotlin/JS compiles Kotlin code into javascript code, and through Kotlin/Native we can compile Kotlin to machinecode for any platform (for example IOS, Android, Windows, Linux and Mac).\n\nThrough Kotlins new multiplatform project we use these modules to compile kotlin for multiple platforms at the same time. This allows us to use Kotlin as a fullstack language for website development, where the backend/api and the frontend/website are both completly written i Kotlin. This gives us some benefits like allowings us to leverage Kotlins language advantages everywhere we want, and lets us share common code between the frontend and the backend.\n\nI have tried this out for a hobby site and I will try to present the advantages and disadvantages kotlin/multiplatform brings to the web scene. At the same time we will look at some interesting things they are doing with multiplatform, how multiplatform works, and the interesting possibilities kotlin/multiplatform creates.",

By using cutting edge technology, I have surpassed the likes of Google and Tesla to solve self-driving vehicles - at least in a video game they didn’t try to solve: TrackMania, a popular racing game. I will present the different parts of my pipeline, ranging from the features that are used to how the car performs actions and the model training itself, which was done using OpenAIs state-of-the-art algorithm called proximal policy optimization. Most importantly, you will get to see the AI in action.\n\nWhether you have prior experience with machine learning or not, I believe you will find the presentation interesting. The talk will contain technical aspects, but they will be presented and explained in a way that makes it possible for beginners and non-technical audience to follow. Perhaps you’re just a curious TrackMania veteran? I will try to make justice to the game you love.\n\nJoin me for half an hour of fun and entertainment. As a bonus, you might learn something as well!",

      "Description": "The stereotypical geek as someone who is hacking away alone in a basement is outdated. On the contrary, as a developer it is important to have social skills and good collaboration skills because most developers work in teams. An essential part of work is to look at, understand, improve and together learn from each other's code. A common form of this is code review, where developers review code written by their colleagues. That feedback from code reviews is received often and continuous is essential in making it “work”.\nI have worked in teams where code reviews become optional (in a good way), because we have such a large emphasis on collaboration. Feedback is received earlier and it is much easier and less of an obstacle to act on it. With it also comes less risk for the project and more freedom for the teams members. Sounds good right? How do we achieve it?\n\"",

      "Description": "You can become a tester through multiple ways: e.g. with computer science background from university, through being a domain expert in some business, through additional testing studies at a re-education program, or just starting to test and learning by doing. There are many ways, as there are also many skills needed in testing. No-one has all those skills to start with, regardless of the background. \n\nBut can you somehow develop all those skills, or many of those skills? Can you become a multitalented tester / developer? Yes, you can. By understanding the combination of needed skills for different testing tasks, you can develop your own personal career path to become a true multitalent. Not only test automation, not only usability testing, not only being a scrum master, but, for example, a combination of all of them. \n\nThe presentation will outline typical backgrounds for testers, different skills, different learning routes, and different typical combinations of multitalents. Kari will also briefly share his route to becoming the Tester of the Year 2021 after a 25-year journey, his own multitalentedness. It is then up to you to see which one is for you, or do you want to become your own, unique testing multitalent?",

      "Description": "Looking at a code base one often gets the feeling that it should \"\"have better design\"\", be split into more reasonable chunks or have more clarity. However, conducting a refactoring based on a mere feeling is tricky and suggesting PR fixes without good arguments and helpful ideas on what to change and why might be unfruitful and frustrating.\n\nStratified design is a term used e.g by Eric Normand (2021) to describe a functional approach in which code is looked at as layers. Each function / piece of code should belong to a specific layer - stratum - based on how it relates to other code and what goal it has.\n\nIn my client work I have found stratified design to be a valuable tool in both refactoring and building new as it provides a guideline for making actual low-level design decisions. This presentation demonstrates the use of this pattern with two koa based nodejs api endpoints as examples (from an actual project, anonymized for the presentation). I will show how a new api endpoint was added with stratified design in mind and compare the decisions made to an unrefactored endpoint.\"",
