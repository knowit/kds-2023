      | <strong>Dinner.</strong> We will eat dinner together on Friday evening. More information later.

    p
      | <strong>Name badges</strong> will be handed out in order to make it easier with names and companies.

    p
      | <strong>Hotel check inn</strong>. You will be able to pick up your room key at the hotel reception sometime after 16:00 on Friday.

    p
      | Please stay until the end on Saturday. <strong>All speakers deserve an audience.</strong>

    p
      | Be prepared to change room. We do not know how popular sessions will be. Perhaps we will have to switch the room just before a session starts. Please help us make it as smooth as possible.

      | A speaker slot may become available last minute. Do you have a talk that you can present? Please prepare to quickly jump in as a speaker.

    p
      | The talks with this symbol ðŸŽ¥ next to them will be recorded. These will either be uploaded to the official Knowit YouTube channel or Shareit, depending on speakersâ€™ preferences. Look out for a newsletter from Creative Crew following the conference with links to the talks. NB: please be aware that there might be some last minute changes in the program. Hence, it is always better to attend the talk at the conference rather than relying on being able to watch a recording at a later time.

    p
      | We have, once again, made a cool <strong>KDS t-shirt</strong>. Please, just take one and note that there are different sizes for men and women.

    p
      | <strong>Share!</strong> Use hashtag <strong>#kds2019</strong> on twitter, blog on your company blogs and make this conference visible to everyone! There is lots of great content to be shared. But, please be careful not to share something that is marked as confidential or is customer related.
