However, conducting a refactoring based on a mere feeling is tricky and suggesting PR fixes without good arguments and helpful ideas on what to change and why might be unfruitful and frustrating.\n\nStratified design is a term used e.g by Eric Normand (2021) to describe a functional approach in which code is looked at as layers. Each function / piece of code should belong to a specific layer - stratum - based on how it relates to other code and what goal it has.\n\nIn my client work I have found stratified design to be a valuable tool in both refactoring and building new as it provides a guideline for making actual low-level design decisions. This presentation demonstrates the use of this pattern with two koa based nodejs api endpoints as examples (from an actual project, anonymized for the presentation).
